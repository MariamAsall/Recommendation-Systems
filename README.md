# Recommendation-Systems

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic recommendation system using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and item features, with a focus on nutritional data. The repository includes a sample dataset (`nutrients_csvfile.csv`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`Recommendation_Systems.ipynb`) that walks through the development and evaluation of the recommendation model.

## Features

- Reads and processes a nutritional dataset.
- Explores data and visualizes key statistics.
- Implements a simple recommendation algorithm (content-based or collaborative filtering, depending on the notebook).
- Provides recommendations based on user input or preferences.
- Evaluates model performance with relevant metrics.

## Dataset

- **File:** `nutrients_csvfile.csv`
- **Description:** Contains nutritional information about various food items.
- **Sample columns:**  
  - `Food_Name`  
  - `Calories`  
  - `Protein`  
  - `Fat`  
  - `Carbohydrates`  
  - (Additional nutrient columns as available)

**Sample:**
```csv
Food_Name,Calories,Protein,Fat,Carbohydrates
Apple,52,0.3,0.2,14
Banana,96,1.3,0.3,27
...
```

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MariamAsall/Recommendation-Systems.git
   cd Recommendation-Systems
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   *(Recommended: use a virtual environment)*
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `Recommendation_Systems.ipynb` in your browser.

---

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**  
   `Recommendation_Systems.ipynb`

2. **Run the notebook cells in order:**  
   - The notebook will guide you through data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
   - You can modify the input or parameters to experiment with different recommendation strategies.

3. **Get Recommendations:**  
   - Input your preferences (e.g., desired calorie range, high protein foods) as prompted in the notebook.
   - The system will output a list of recommended food items matching your criteria.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Loading & Exploration:**  
  The notebook loads the CSV file, checks for missing values, and provides summary statistics and visualizations.

- **Preprocessing:**  
  Handles missing data, normalizes or scales features as needed, and prepares the data for modeling.

- **Recommendation Algorithm:**  
  - *Content-Based Filtering:* Recommends items similar to a user's stated preferences based on nutrient features.
  - *(If collaborative filtering is implemented:)* Uses user-item interaction data to suggest items based on similar users' preferences.

- **Evaluation:**  
  The notebook may include evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE/MAE if ratings data is present.

---

## Results

- The notebook displays recommended items based on sample user queries.
- Visualizations and summary tables show the effectiveness of the recommendation approach.
- *(If implemented:)* Evaluation metrics such as RMSE or MAE are reported for model performance.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError:**  
  Ensure `nutrients_csvfile.csv` is present in the repository directory.

- **Library Import Errors:**  
  Make sure all required Python packages are installed.

- **Data Format Issues:**  
  Check that the CSV file matches the expected format (column names, data types).

- **Jupyter Notebook Issues:**  
  Restart the kernel and rerun all cells if you encounter execution errors.
